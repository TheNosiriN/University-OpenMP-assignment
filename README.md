# University-OpenMP-assignment
I'm not even in University yet lol, but I've decided to make this freelance work open-sourced because it seems to be a pretty common assignment in Computer Science.

# Implementation A
This part inputs a .pgm raw image file, uses OpenMP to compute a perwitt filter on the pixels then outputs to a new .pgm file.

# Implementation C
This part generates 10,000 singed integers with a custom hash rng, then performs a parallel quicksort algorithm using OpenMP to sort them.
